Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).
For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.

Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.

Constraints:
  1 <= arr.length <= 100
  1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length
  All integers in arr are unique (i.e. arr is a permutation of the integers from 1 to arr.length).
